Still want to:
    --implement sorting based on amount, name (ASC, DSC)
    --default sorting based on date
    --make the seeded data have an owner so it's only visible on the owner's account and able to be modified by the owner
    --update readme with route tables
    --put ERD in the API's readme
    --net total change colors based on if positive vs negative number
    --user flow through app
